/*
flex-basis is a starting point, an ideal or hypothetical size of things before any growing or shrinking happens

When shooting horizontally flex-basis deals with width. When shooting vertically it controls height.

If there's not enough space then they'll have to shrink according to their flex-shrink ratios. And if there's extra space available they can expand to fill it according to their flex-grow ratio if they have any.

The final flex-basis can't be higher than its max-width(or max-height when shooting vertically).If it is higher, the final flex-basis just becomes that max value.

The final flex-basis can't be lower than its min-width (or min-height when shooting vertically). If it is lower, the final flex-basis just becomes that min value.

It defaults to flex-basis: auto, which means to fallback to the width (or the height when shooting vertically).
